# LeetCode-SQL-Solutions

SQL skills are one of the leading demands of any company. 
Therefore every programmer should be able to write atleast 'Easy' level Queries so that he/she has a basic understanding of working on Database.

And, what better way to sharpen those skills than to practice on LeetCode!

Here in this repository I am sharing all my answers to the SQL Questions of LeetCode. My aim is not to help you cheat and just put down solutions just for the sake of submitting. My aim is to help you in case you get stuck with your solutions and provide you with the easiest solution possible.

I hope this helps!
Happy Learning!!!
